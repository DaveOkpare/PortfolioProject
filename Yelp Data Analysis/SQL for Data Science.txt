Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000
ii. Business table = 10,000
iii. Category table = 10,000
iv. Checkin table = 10,000
v. elite_years table = 10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table = 10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000
ix. review table = 10,000
x. tip table = 10,000
xi. user table = 10,000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10,000
ii. Hours = 1,562
iii. Category = 2,643
iv. Attribute = 1,115
v. Review = 8,090 (business_id)
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 6,493 (business_id)
viii. Tip = 3,979 (user_id)
ix. User = 10,000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2,780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
Yes! On average users with <50 reviews don't have more than 2 fans. The more the reviews the more likely the user obtaining more followers. Some users on the other have a lot of reviews and very few fans. 
	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: Yes, there are more reviews with the word "love" than there are with the word "hate".

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Answer: The group with 2-3 stars tend to open for longer hours than the group with 4-5 stars who open for half the day.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Answer: Yes, restaurants in Toronto with 2-3 stars tend to have not more than 47 reviews. While the number of reviews for restaurants in Toronto with 4-5 stars could be as much as 89.
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Answer: The group with 2-3 stars are mostly located in Downtown Core and Entertainment District. While the group with 4-5 stars are mostly located in Etobicoke, High Park, Niagara and Willowdale.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT stars,
       city,
       hours,
       neighborhood,
       review_count,
       count(id) AS total_businesses
FROM business b
LEFT JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
LEFT JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id
WHERE city LIKE 'Toronto'
  AND c.category LIKE 'Restaurants'
  AND stars BETWEEN 2 AND 5
GROUP BY stars,
         hours
ORDER BY stars


2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         Businesses that are still open have more reviews on average to the ones that are closed.
         
ii. Difference 2:
         There are more businesses that are still open than the ones closed.
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT is_open,
       COUNT(*) AS total,
       AVG(review_count) AS average,
       CASE
           WHEN is_open = 0 THEN 'CLOSED'
           ELSE 'OPEN'
       END AS status
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open

+---------+-------+---------------+--------+
| is_open | total |       average | status |
+---------+-------+---------------+--------+
|       0 |  1520 | 23.1980263158 | CLOSED |
|       1 |  8480 | 31.7570754717 | OPEN   |
+---------+-------+---------------+--------+
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
